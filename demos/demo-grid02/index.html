                This example demonstrates how to reposition content in a view by
                stacking multiple grids on top of one another. The goal of the
                example is to retain a logical markup structure while still
                allowing content to be split up and positioned on the grid. Case
                in point: From a HTML semantics standpoint, the main area should
                come before the sidebar area, and both should live on the same
                level without extra wrappers. This demo shows how stacking two
                grids allows the sidebar items to appear as if they are placed
                on the same grid as the main content while they are in reality
                placed in a separate grid positioned within and superimposed on
                top of the original grid.

                <p>
                  CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout tool. It is great for
                  layout out content in a grid, and for laying out content in
                  two dimensions.

                <h3 class="bucket-title">Flex is great too</h3>
                <p>
                  Grid is not always the right option for layuts. If for example
                  you need to lay out a series of identical boxes like those you
                  see here, Flex may be a better option.

            <p>
              The solution provided here is limited by the lack of support for
              subgrids. If subgrids were available, the solution would be more
              refined. That said, the lack of subgrid was what brought me to
              this solution, and it has practical applications well outside of
              the current demo. So maybe not having subgrid has opened the door
              to other more interesting opportunities?
